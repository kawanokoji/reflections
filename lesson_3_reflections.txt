When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- I would use a remote repository when I was collaborating with someone else or working from multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- I want to pull changes manually rather than automatically synch because I can dictate what to synch when.
